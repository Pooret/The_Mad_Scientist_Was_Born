## This is shell from the future come to warn you of today's date, when the mad scientist's crazy, idiotic idea was hatched from his complete lack of foresight due to mental illness and his irresponsible girlfriend, me. You need to stop him shell! The world depends on it!

Here are the mad scientists notes I was able to find


## Note 1: His CRRAzzy STupID IDEA

Muhaahahahaahaaaa. I, the evil mad scientist Eyam Abadaman, will create a device that I named my Mostly Affectionate Deep Learning Algorithmic Determinator, an AI that takes in n number of parameterized vectors describing historical features (e.g. payment, default, legal, education, subscriptions, chemical components, drug interactions, legal documentation, government policies, bevaior, etc) for m samples to be represented as m x n vectors in n-dimensional space (*note this is just an mxn datatable, but it sounds fancy and is useful for the next part of my evil plan*). 

The distances between two vectors in n-dimensonal space represents how far apart those two samples are in terms of their parameters (e.g. a "law" abiding citiizen would have clusters centered around features detailing criminal history, as well as possible predictors, such as race, income, level of education, city of birth, job history, payment history and so on...)

These data can be grouped into samples that are most like each other (using an unsupervised learning method) to identify "ideal" samples. The training data would be made of subsamples of the total data collected, and holdout data would be set aside..

Finish ideas: 
1. predict where sample will fall in grouping
2. find distances between sample parameters and an "ideal" set of parameters (e.g. person susbcribes to most frugal plan, and we want to see what behavioral and historical changes need to be tweaked (e.g. number targeted ads, type of ads, subsciprtion history, spending history) to get to target parameter value or gruoping).
3. Apply to law, government, policy making, business developent, psychology, etc.
